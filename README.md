## Challenges + Improvements
I got to work with a database which was very exciting but as well it came with its challenges.
Working with fetch calls and post request was very difficult to get my head around but with help I was able to do fetch calls and as well was able to create post requests. I would like to go back to this project and make it more presentable. Due to time frame I was only able to make functionality work and was not able to 
invest a lot of time on CSS/SCSS and as well I was not able to properly hide and show views for the user.
